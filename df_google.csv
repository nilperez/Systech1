We started with the Fried lobster tail😍
This is a must try.
Both salads were great . I ordered the wagyu strip and it was not what I expected it to be , I mentioned it to the Kris , he along with management did not hesitate to make it right . I ordered the ribeye along with brocolini and it was  really good. Then came dessert 😁
Creme Brule and a key lime pie.

In his defense, we can say that the waiters are very little available and very grouchy. We were there for a bachelorette party and in addition to waiting for a long time at the counter without being served, then he told us that they weren't even making mojitos and at our request for ""house"" advice, he gave us a paltry shottino for $ 6. . Very little cute place to see. The only positive thing is the music until late even during the week

A sua discolpa, possiamo dire che i camerieri sono decisamente poco disponibili e molto scorbutici. Eravamo là per una addio al nubilato e oltre ad attendere per parecchio al banco senza essere servite, poi ci ha detto che non facevano neanche i mojito e alla nostra richiesta di un consiglio ""della casa"", ci ha dato un misero shottino per 6$.

Ordered the same thing Ive gotten Mozzarella sticks and Chicken Parm.

Youre supposed to get 4 sticks. Only got 3. And they were warm at best.

Chicken Parm portions were smaller and over cooked.

They even cut back on the amount of bread they give you .

Our waiter was nice amd the drinks were Good. But tbh Im not coming back.

The plate with only three mozzarella sticks looked like they're cutting corners.

So how was the food??? I can honestly say it exceeded all of my expectations! We got the family meal because there were 16 of us, but there was more than enough food to go around. Get the MOLE Flight. Four different kinds of mole and every one of them flavorful and savory.

0x80c2b87f94d62329:0xe605cc1bb679a2ac,1.11135E+20,4,"Read the article in the L.A. Times that awarded Guelaguetza the 2021 Gold award and I just had to see what all the fuss is about. It's now one of my favorite mexican restaurants ever, and certainly the best Oaxacan restaurant in L.A.

First off, you WILL get addicted to the complimentary tortillas chips with red mole and sprinkled queso fresco. It was a supremely simple dish, but what a great way to be welcomed to their moles! It also allows you to try one of their other moles for your entree if you want a broader sampling of flavors. I'd swear the red mole, with it's pronounced but not overpowering sweetness, could almost pass for a japanese curry, minus the curry spice, of course.

As an appetizer, the quesillo fundido, a gooey blend of melted Oaxaca cheese, chorizo and mushrooms, was delicious wrapped inside a warm ""Kernel of Truth"" brand organic corn tortilla (hands down the best corn tortillas made in L.A.). Meanwhile the chalupas--crispy tortillas with a chewy center, topped with veggies doused in a guajillo and garlic sauce--were a great, flavorful option, especially those looking for something vegetarian. Both appetizers could actually qualify as entrees too, so don't order with your eyes.

The black mole chicken breast with rice was flavorful. The mole carries everything here, as the chicken breast is boiled but otherwise unadorned except for the mole sauce. But the mole is some of the best I've had: earthy chocolate, smoky chili pepper, sweet yet also savory. Quite complex! It was a treat, and so good that I saved some of the mole to top my eggs for breakfast the next morning.

The tamale with rajas (chili pepper and chicken) was excellent as well, and I regret that I didn't order another one to go. The masa was soft, not doughy, and full of flavor, thanks to the spicy but not overwhelming filling. it's also 50% larger than the typical tamale you can find from a street vendor in L.A., and worth every penny.

The jamaica (hibiscus tea) was exceptional, with the look of red wine and a that mix of slight hibiscus tanginess and cinnamon/sugar sweetness that you expect. On the boozy side, the blended mango margarita was potent, the smokiness of the tequila is definitely the top note, with a little bit of mango in the bottom to remind you that it's not all alcohol.

The only issues we had were with service. Everyone on staff seems to have a walkie-talkie, but they seem a bit overstretched, possibly due to their popularity. Make a reservation if you have the time. If not, use the Resy app and be within 3 miles of the restaurant to have a chance of snagging a table in a reasonable amount of time (within 15-20 minutes).  Otherwise, we couldn't complain about the food. It's definitely worth it to visit Guelaguetza at least once if you're a fan of Mexican food, and essential if you want to sample the best of what Oaxacan cuisine can offer without booking a plane ticket.",1233,CA,150691,Guelaguetza Restaurant,Mole sauce is the star at this kid-friendly Mexican spot featuring Oaxacan fare & colorful decor.,34.0524074,-118.3006681,Bar
